# How to Contribute

We're extremely glad that you are looking to contribute to this suite of quantum benchmarks. We want this project to grow and thrive with community involvement, so we welcome any and all contributions! 

First and foremost, please ensure through all interactions in this community you follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting New Issues

Please use the [Issues tab](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks/issues) for **both bugs and features**. For these two types of improvements, we have different processes.

### Bug Reports

- Make sure the bug doesn't already exist as an open issue.
- If the bug hasn't been reported before, [open a new issue](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks/issues/new). Include a title, clear description with as much information as possible, and a code sample which demonstrates the un-desired behavior.

### Feature Reports

- If you have an suggested feature to the repository, include enough information about what is missing and, if possible, a suggestion for how to implement it.
- Consider how this feature might fit in with existing projects and the goals of the project. Once submitted to the Issues tab, the members of the community and maintainers can provide feedback. 

## Contributing Pull Requests

For all GitHub pull requests to the project, clearly state what has been done (more information about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Provide extensive information such that all of the changes are rationalized. 

- If you found a bug and found a suggested fix, to add it to the repository, please make a pull request explaining the incorrect behavior and what was done to fix it.
- Before working on a feauture, please submit the suggested feature into the Issues tab to get feedback on how the feature will fit in with the project. No one wants to spend time working on code that ends up not being implemented.

## Coding Conventions

We do not have any explict coding conventions currently. Please ensure that any suggested code improvements follow a somewhat similar style to the code that already exists.
